          <span>About <b>Me</b></span>
          <p class="aboutme__text">My journey into development began with a deep curiosity about how code and design can come together to create
          exceptional digital experiences. During my master’s in UX/UI Frontend Development, I specialized in building web
          applications that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and efficient. Mastering technologies like
          HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, and React has enabled me to develop user interfaces that are both intuitive and technically
          robust.</p>
          <p class="aboutme__text">Each project has been an opportunity to dive deeper into the technical aspects of frontend development. I’ve dedicated
          myself to perfecting the implementation of responsive and dynamic designs, ensuring that every component not only looks
          good but also functions smoothly across different devices and browsers. Performance optimization and accessibility are
          always priorities in my work, driving me to constantly explore new techniques and tools that enhance the user
          experience.</p>
          <p class="aboutme__text">React has been fundamental to my approach, allowing me to build modular and scalable interfaces that adapt to the evolving needs of projects. Through Figma, I’ve translated design concepts into interactive prototypes, which I then
          implement with precision in code, ensuring seamless integration between design and development.</p>
          <p class="aboutme__text">What excites me most is the ability to transform ideas into tangible digital products, where every line of code contributes to an enhanced user experience. My technical focus is on writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code,
          while collaborating closely with designers and other developers to ensure that every project not only meets technical
          requirements but also exceeds user expectations.</p>
          <p class="aboutme__text">I am committed to developing web solutions that are both innovative and robust, leveraging best practices in UX/UI and frontend development. My goal is to continue creating digital products that combine exceptional design with impeccable
          technical performance.</p>

          <p class="projects__text">I took a design created in Figma and translated it into a fully functional website, ensuring fidelity to the original
          design in both aesthetics and usability. I implemented the design using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (or React.js if
          applicable), optimizing the code to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience</p>

          <p class="projects__text">I transformed the initial user interface design from Figma into a fully functional web version. I used HTML5, CSS3, and
          JavaScript to ensure that every design element, from the course layout to the interactivity of buttons, stayed true to
          the original vision. I made sure the final implementation was not only aesthetically consistent but also optimized for
          responsive performance across various devices.</p>

            <p class="projects__text">I implemented the design of a social media dashboard, initially conceptualized in Figma, using advanced web
            technologies. I ensured the integrity of the dark mode design and the interactivity of elements, such as real-time
            charts and statistics, by leveraging CSS Grid and Flexbox for precise and responsive layouts. Additionally, I optimized
            the user experience by implementing JavaScript to dynamically handle data updates, and used asynchronous loading
            techniques to ensure smooth performance. The entire project was structured with React.js, allowing me to create reusable
            components and maintain code scalability.</p>
